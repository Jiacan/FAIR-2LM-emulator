# FAIR-2LM-emulator
This repository stores the code for emulating projections of zostoga (global-mean thermosteric sea level rise) and zos (dynamic sea level rise deviating from the global mean) based on FAIR-2LM.

Contents:
1. FAIR-TLM: code for the FAIR-2LM
2. Thermal-expansion: code for emulating the zostoga using upper-mixed layer and deep-ocean layer temperature changes produced by FAIR-TLM.
3. Two-timescale: code for emulating the zos using a two-timescale pattern scaling approaches based on temperature changes produced by FAIR-TLM.The main code of generating slopes is Two_timescale_patternscale.py.
